<p>在计算机编程<a class="glossaryLink" href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/computer_programming" title="computer programming: Computer programming is a process of composing and organizing a collection of instructions. These tell a computer/software program what to do in a language which the computer understands. These instructions come in the form of many different languages such as C++, Java, JavaScript, HTML, Python, Ruby, and Rust.">computer programming</a>领域中，抽象编程指在研发大型复杂软件系统时，通过抽象的方法来降低编程复杂度，实现系统快速高效设计和开发的编程模式。它将系统各功能实现的技术细节隐藏在相对简单的 <a class="glossaryLink" href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/API" title="APIs: An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of features and rules that exist inside a software program (the application) enabling interaction with it through software - as opposed to a human user interface.
