<p>A <strong>general header</strong> is an <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/Header">HTTP header</a> that can be used in both request and response messages but doesn't apply to the content itself. Depending on the context they are used in, general headers are either <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/Response_header">response</a> or <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/request_header">request headers</a>. However, they are not <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/entity_header">entity headers</a>.</p>

<p>The most common general headers are <a href="/vi/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Date" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>Date</code></a>, <a href="/vi/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>Cache-Control</code></a> or <a href="/vi/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Connection" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>Connection</code></a>.</p>
