<h2 id="LƯỢC_SỬ">LƯỢC SỬ </h2>

<p>Vào năm 1990, như một phần của công trình thiết kế web <a class="glossaryLink" href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/World_Wide_Web" title="Web: The World Wide Web—commonly referred to as WWW, W3, or the Web—is an interconnected system of public webpages accessible through the Internet. The Web is not the same as the Internet: the Web is one of many applications built on top of the Internet.">Web</a>, Tim Berners-Lee tạo ra định nghĩa  <a class="glossaryLink" href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/hypertext" title="hypertext: Hypertext is text that contains links to other texts, as opposed to a single linear flow like in a novel.">hypertext</a>, thứ mà đã được Berners-Lee chính thức công nhận vào năm tiếp theo thông qua markup được dựa phần lớn vào<a class="glossaryLink" href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/SGML" title="SGML: The Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) is an ISO specification for defining declarative markup languages.">SGML</a>. The <a class="glossaryLink" href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/IETF" title="IETF: The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is a worldwide organization that drafts specifications governing the mechanisms behind the Internet, especially the TCP/IP or Internet Protocol Suite.">IETF</a> began formally specifying HTML in 1993, and after several drafts released version 2.0 in 1995. In 1994 Berners-Lee founded the <a class="glossaryLink" href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/W3C" title="W3C: The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international body that maintains Web-related rules and frameworks.">W3C</a> to develop the Web. In 1996, the W3C took over the HTML work and published the HTML 3.2 recommendation a year later. HTML 4.0 was released in 1999 and became an <a class="glossaryLink" href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/ISO" title="ISO: ISO (International Organization for Standardization) is a global association that develops uniform criteria coordinating the companies in each major industry.">ISO</a> standard in 2000.</p>

<p>At that time, the W3C nearly abandoned HTML in favor of <a class="glossaryLink" href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/XHTML" title="XHTML: HTML can travel over the network to a browser either in HTML syntax or an XML syntax called XHTML.">XHTML</a>, prompting the founding of an independent group called <a class="glossaryLink" href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/WHATWG" title="WHATWG: The WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group) is a community that maintains and develops web standards, including DOM, Fetch, and HTML. Employees of Apple, Mozilla, and Opera established WHATWG in 2004.">WHATWG</a> in 2004. Thanks to WHATWG, work on <a class="glossaryLink" href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML5" title="HTML5: The latest stable release of HTML, HTML5 takes HTML from a simple markup for structuring a document to a full app development platform. Among other features, HTML5 includes new elements and JavaScript APIs to enhance storage, multimedia, and hardware access.">HTML5</a> continued: the two organizations released the first draft in 2008 and the final standard in 2014.</p>

<h2 id="Concept_and_syntax">Concept and syntax</h2>

<p>An HTML document is a plaintext document structured with <a class="glossaryLink" href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/element" title="elements: An element is a part of a webpage. In XML and HTML, an element may contain a data item or a chunk of text or an image, or perhaps nothing. A typical element includes an opening tag with some attributes, enclosed text content, and a closing tag.
 ">elements</a>. Elements are surrounded by matching opening and closing <a class="glossaryLink" href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/tag" title="tags: In HTML a tag is used for creating an element.  The name of an HTML element is the name used in angle brackets such as &lt;p> for paragraph.  Note that the end tag's name is preceded by a slash character, &quot;&lt;/p>&quot;, and that in empty elements the end tag is neither required nor allowed. If attributes are not mentioned, default values are used in each case.">tags</a>. Each tag begins and ends with angle brackets (<code>&lt;&gt;</code>). There are a few empty or <em>void</em> tags that cannot enclose any text, for instance <a href="/vi/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;img&gt;</code></a>.</p>

<p>You can extend HTML tags with <a class="glossaryLink" href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/attribute" title="attributes: An attribute extends a tag, changing its behavior or providing metadata. An attribute always has the form name=value (the attribute's identifier followed by its associated value).">attributes</a>, which provide additional information affecting how the browser interprets the element:</p>

<p>An HTML file is normally saved with an <code>.htm</code> or <code>.html</code> extension, served by a <a class="glossaryLink" href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/Server" title="web server: A server is a software or hardware offering a service to a user, usually referred to as client.  A hardware server is a shared computer on a network, usually powerful and housed in a data center.  A software server (often running on a hardware server) is a program that provides services to client programs or a user interface to human clients.">web server</a>, and can be rendered by any <a class="glossaryLink" href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/Browser" title="Web browser: A Web browser or browser is a program that retrieves and displays pages from the Web, and lets users access further pages through hyperlinks. A browser is the most familiar type of user agent.">Web browser</a>.</p>
