<p>In this talk, several contributors of the MDN project look at the past ten years of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org">developer.mozilla.org</a>, and at the decade to come. You will hear the story of different wiki software migrations, how a documentation community was built, and many more highlights of the history of the site. The group then also talks about current challenges and projects the MDN community is working on this year.</p>

<p>MDN is also a place for Mozilla engineers, such as Gecko or Firefox hackers, add-on developers, and Firefox OS contributors.</p>

<article class="chapter chapter-justtext" id="mdn-history">
<h2 id="The_history_of_MDN_Pre-wiki_era_–_Netscape_DevEdge">The history of MDN <small> Pre-wiki era – Netscape DevEdge</small></h2>

<p>In the early days there was <em>DevEdge</em>, the developer documentation from Netscape which formed the basis of some of MDN's documentation. Have a look at the past on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020819120942/http://devedge.netscape.com/">archive.org</a>:</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020819120942/http://devedge.netscape.com/"><img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/11581/devedge.png" alt="Netscape DevEdge" style="height: 300px; width: 600px;"> </a></p>

<p>On October 12, 2004, this popular developer website was shut down by AOL, Netscape's parent company. Only a few months later, in February 2005, <a href="https://blog.lizardwrangler.com/">Mitchell Baker</a> was able <a href="https://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2005/02/23/devmo-and-devedge-updates/"> to rescue DevEdge</a> and reached an agreement with AOL that allowed Mozilla to post, modify, and create new documents based on the former Netscape DevEdge materials. In other words, what happened to the Mozilla source in 1998 finally happened for Netscape's developer documentation as well: <strong>It became open source</strong>.</p>

<p>Deb Richardson joined the Mozilla Foundation as a Technical Editor and lead the new <em>DevMo</em> project for community driven developer documentation.</p>

<h2 id="MediaWiki_The_first_wiki_engine">MediaWiki <small> The first wiki engine</small></h2>

<p>With MediaWiki as the new underlying project platform, the Mozilla developer documentation has been made editable for anyone starting in July 2005. A new collaborative element in Mozilla was established and since then anyone is welcome to help making it better and to share knowledge. A new international community began to grow and to translate developer contents into other languages.</p>

<h2 id="DekiWiki_The_second_wiki_engine">DekiWiki <small> The second wiki engine</small></h2>

<p>In August 2008, the Mozilla Developer Center switched to <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/dekiwiki/">MindTouch DekiWiki</a>, a powerful and new content management system and wiki system for technical documentation. This platform change was quite controversial in the community that was used to MediaWiki from 2005 on and built tools around it.</p>

<p>With the code living on GitHub, the community started to contribute to MDN's CMS as well. From now on, hacking on MDN includes both writing documentation and Kuma coding.</p>

<p>The redesign of MDN was a big project. <a href="https://twitter.com/mart3ll">Sean Martell</a> designed the new MDN visual identity. It was then an iterative process with a beta user group of 3000 MDNers during several months. The new look was behind a "Waffle flag" (MDN's feature flag system). Major shout-outs also to <a href="https://twitter.com/davidwalshblog/">David Walsh</a> who was really championing the entire redesign and gave MDN the front-end that it deserves.</p>

<h2 id="Community_around_Open_Web_docs_Community-driven_browser-agnostic_Open_Web_documentation">Community around Open Web docs <small> Community-driven, browser-agnostic Open Web documentation</small></h2>

<p>At some point in 2010, especially when <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2010/10/web-standards-doc-sprint-finis/">community members and Technical Writers met in Paris</a>, it became more obvious that MDN's focus is clearly shifting from "Let's document all things Firefox!" to "Let's document the Web!". Documentation has been cleaned up and restructured over the last few years, so that MDN's open Web documentation is browser-agnostic. This material, useful for anyone developing for the Web, is our most popular and most widely used content.</p>

<p>Different browser vendors have joined every once in a while to help shape this part of MDN. This cross-browser collaboration has been very successful and is appreciated by MDN's readers.</p>

<p>Localization is a big part of the Mozilla community; it is a component of almost every project and product. Using Kuma, MDN is also very localizable and suited for the needs of <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Localize">our l10n community</a>. The W3C specifications and other resources describing the Web's functionality have no direct goals, and have communities that provide specs in multiple languages. Especially for beginners, MDN is the first step to explore web technologies, so it's our aim to be there for everyone. MDN has a broad audience and aims to include not only native English speakers. It is appreciated all around the globe.</p>

<p>Everyone involved with MDN really cares about the web being open and accessible, and that's why we have the localization teams and all of the people contributing. MDN hopes to continue to be a key player in keeping the Web the way we feel it should be.</p>

<p>One big part of this future is going to be learning resources. There will be a lot more Web developers over the next ten years.</p>

<p>Another big part of our job is maintaining and updating the information we already have, so we can always serve relevant content to Web developers.</p>

<p>What is changing and will likely change more in the future, is how information is consumed. Today people searching for information and looking up documentation. In the future, MDN documentation might be delivered directly in code editors, Firefox Developer Tools, and many other developer tools and services.</p>
