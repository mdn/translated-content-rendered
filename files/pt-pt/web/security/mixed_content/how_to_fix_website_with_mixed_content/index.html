<p>A partir do <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Releases/23" title="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Releases/23">Firefox 23</a>, o Firefox bloqueia o <a href="/en-US/docs/Security/MixedContent#Mixed_active_content" title="/en-US/docs/Security/MixedContent#Mixed_active_content">conteúdo misto ativo </a>por predefinição. Isto segue uma prática adotada pelo Internet Explorer (A partir da <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/06/23/internet-explorer-9-security-part-4-protecting-consumers-from-malicious-mixed-content.aspx" title="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/06/23/internet-explorer-9-security-part-4-protecting-consumers-from-malicious-mixed-content.aspx">versão 9</a>) e <a href="http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2011/06/trying-to-end-mixed-scripting.html" title="http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2011/06/trying-to-end-mixed-scripting.html">Chrome</a>.</p>

<p>Esta página explica a que deverá prestar atenção, como um programador da Web.</p>

<h2 id="O_seu_site_da_Web_poderá_crachar">O seu site da Web poderá crachar</h2>

<p>If your website delivers HTTPS pages, all <a href="/en-US/docs/Security/MixedContent#Mixed_active_content" title="/en-US/docs/Security/MixedContent#Mixed_active_content">active mixed content</a> delivered via HTTP on this pages will be blocked by default. Consequently, your website may appear broken to users (if iframes or plugins don't load, etc.). <a href="/en-US/docs/Security/MixedContent#Mixed_passivedisplay_content" title="/en-US/docs/Security/MixedContent#Mixed_passive.2Fdisplay_content">Passive mixed content</a> is displayed by default, but users can set a preference to block this type of content, as well.</p>

<p>Note that since mixed content blocking already happens in Chrome and Internet Explorer, it is very likely that if your website works in both of these browsers, it will work equally well in Firefox with mixed content blocking.</p>

<p>In any case, the best way to know if something is broken in Firefox is to download the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/" title="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/">latest Firefox Edition</a>, open different pages on your website with the <a href="/en-US/docs/Tools/Web_Console" title="/en-US/docs/Tools/Web_Console">web console</a> open (enable the "Security" messages) and see if anything related to mixed content is reported. Or use an online crawler like <a href="http://www.jitbit.com/sslcheck/">SSL-check</a>, a desktop crawler like <a href="https://httpschecker.net/how-it-works">HTTPSChecker</a> that will check your website recursively and find links to insecure content, or a CLI tool like <a href="https://github.com/agis/mcdetect">mcdetect</a>. If nothing is said about mixed content, your website is in good shape: Keep making excellent websites!</p>

<p>The best strategy to avoid mixed content blocking is to serve all the content as HTTPS instead of HTTP.</p>

<p><strong>Para o seu próprio domínio,</strong> serve all content as HTTPS and fix your links.  Often, the HTTPS version of the content already exists and this just requires adding an "s" to links - http:// to https://.</p>

<p>However, in some cases, the path may just be incorrect to the media in question. There are online as well as offline tools (depending on your operating system) such as <a href="https://wummel.github.io/linkchecker/">linkchecker</a> to help resolve this.</p>

<p><strong>Para outros domínios, </strong>use the site's HTTPS version if available. If HTTPS is not available, you can try contacting the domain and asking them if they can make the content available via HTTPS.</p>
