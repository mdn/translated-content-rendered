<div class="warning notecard">
<p><strong>Importante</strong>: atualmente, não existem implementações conhecidas do algoritmo de estrutura nos navegadores gráficos ou agentes de utilizador da tecnologia assistiva, embora o algoritmo esteja implementado noutro software, tal como verificadores de conformidade . Assim, o algoritmo de <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/sections.html#outline">estrutura</a> não pode ser invocado para transmitir a estrutura do documento aos utilizadores. Recomenda-se que os autores utilizem <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/sections.html#rank">rank</a> (<code><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/sections.html#the-h1,-h2,-h3,-h4,-h5,-and-h6-elements">h1</a></code>-<code><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/sections.html#the-h1,-h2,-h3,-h4,-h5,-and-h6-elements">h6</a></code>) para transmitir a estrutura do documento.</p>
</div>

<p>The HTML5 specification brings several new elements to web developers allowing them to describe the structure of a web document with standard semantics. This document describes these elements and how to use them to define the desired outline for any document.</p>

<h2 id="Estrutura_de_um_documento_em_HTML_4">Estrutura de um documento em HTML 4</h2>

<p>A estrutura de um documento, por exemplo, a estrutura de semântica do que está entre <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> e <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code>, é fundamental para apresentar a página ao utilizador. HTML4 uses the notion of sections and sub-sections of a document to describe its structure. A section is defined by a (<a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;div&gt;</code></a>) element with heading elements (<a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/h1" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;h1&gt;</code></a>, <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/h2" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;h2&gt;</code></a>, <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/h3" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;h3&gt;</code></a>, <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/h4" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;h4&gt;</code></a>, <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/h5" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;h5&gt;</code></a>, or <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/h6" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;h6&gt;</code></a>) within it, defining its title. The relationships of these elements leads to the structure of the document and its outline.</p>

<p>So the following mark-up:</p>

<div style="overflow: hidden;">
<pre class="brush:xml">&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;forest-elephants&quot; &gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Forest elephants&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In this section, we discuss the lesser known forest elephants.
    ...this section continues...
  &lt;div class=&quot;subsection&quot; id=&quot;forest-habitat&quot; &gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Habitat&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Forest elephants do not live in trees but among them.
     ...this subsection continues...
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
</div>

<p>leads to the following outline (without the implicit level numbers displayed):</p>

<pre>1. Forest elephants
   1.1 Habitat
</pre>

<p>The <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;div&gt;</code></a> elements aren&apos;t mandatory to define a new section. The mere presence of a heading element is enough to imply a new section. Therefore,</p>

<pre class="brush:xml">&lt;h1&gt;Forest elephants&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In this section, we discuss the lesser known forest elephants.
    ...this section continues...
  &lt;h2&gt;Habitat&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Forest elephants do not live in trees but among them.
    ...this subsection continues...
  &lt;h2&gt;Diet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Mongolian gerbils&lt;/h1&gt;
</pre>

<p>leads to the following outline:</p>

<pre>1. Forest elephants
   1.1 Habitat
   1.2 Diet
2. Mongolian gerbils
</pre>

<h2 id="Problemas_resolvidos_pelo_HTML5">Problemas resolvidos pelo HTML5</h2>

<p>The HTML 4 definition of the structure of a document and its implied outlining algorithm is very rough and leads to numerous problems:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Usage of <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;div&gt;</code></a> for defining semantic sections, without defining specific values for the <strong>class</strong> attributes makes the automation of the outlining algorithm impossible (&quot;Is that <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;div&gt;</code></a> part of the outline of the page, defining a section or a subsection?&quot; Or &quot;is it only a presentational <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;div&gt;</code></a>, only used for styling?&quot;). In other terms, the HTML4 spec is very imprecise on what is a section and how its scope is defined. Automatic generation of outlines is important, especially for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistive_technology" class="external" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistive_technology">assistive technology</a>, that are likely to adapt the way they present information to the users according to the structure of the document. HTML5 removes the need for <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;div&gt;</code></a> elements from the outlining algorithm by introducing a new element, <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;section&gt;</code></a>, the HTML Section Element.</li>
 <li>Merging several documents is hard: inclusion of a sub-document in a main document means changing the level of the HTML Headings Element so that the outline is kept. This is solved in HTML5 as the newly introduced sectioning elements (<a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;article&gt;</code></a>, <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;section&gt;</code></a>, <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;nav&gt;</code></a> and <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/aside" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;aside&gt;</code></a>) are always subsections of their nearest ancestor section, regardless of what sections are created by internal headings.</li>
 <li>In HTML4, every section is part of the document outline. But documents are often not that linear. A document can have special sections containing information that is not part of, though it is related to, the main flow, like an advertisement block or an explanation box. HTML5 introduces the <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/aside" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;aside&gt;</code></a> element allowing such sections to not be part of the main outline.</li>
 <li>Again, in HTML4, because every section is part of the document outline, there is no way to have sections containing information related not to the document but to the whole site, like logos, menus, table of contents, or copyright information and legal notices. For that purpose, HTML5 introduces three new elements: <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;nav&gt;</code></a> for collections of links, such as a table of contents, <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/footer" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;footer&gt;</code></a> and <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/header" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;header&gt;</code></a> for site-related information. Note that <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/header" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;header&gt;</code></a> and <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/footer" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;footer&gt;</code></a> are not sectioning content like <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;section&gt;</code></a>, rather, they exist to semantically mark up parts of a section.</li>
</ol>

<p>More generally, HTML5 brings precision to the sectioning and heading features, allowing document outlines to be predictable and used by the browser to improve the user experience.</p>

<h2 id="O_algoritmo_de_estrutura_de_HTML5">O algoritmo de estrutura de HTML5</h2>

<p>Let&apos;s consider the algorithms  underlying the way HTML handles sections and outlines.</p>

<h3 id="Definir_secções">Definir secções</h3>

<p>All content lying inside the <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/body" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;body&gt;</code></a> element is part of a section. Sections in HTML5 can be nested. Beside the main section, defined by the <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/body" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;body&gt;</code></a> element, section limits are defined either explicitly or implicitly. Explicitly-defined sections are the content within <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/body" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;body&gt;</code></a>,  <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;section&gt;</code></a>,  <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;article&gt;</code></a>,  <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/aside" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;aside&gt;</code></a>, and <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;nav&gt;</code></a> tags. </p>

<div class="note">Each section can have its own heading hierarchy. Therefore, even a nested section can have an <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/h1" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;h1&gt;</code></a>. See <a href="#Defining_headings">Defining headings</a></div>

<p>Let&apos;s look at an example — here we have a document with a top level section and a footer defined. Inside the top level section we have three subsections, defined by two <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;section&gt;</code></a> elements and an <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/aside" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;aside&gt;</code></a> element:</p>

<pre class="brush:xml">&lt;section&gt;

  &lt;h1&gt;Forest elephants&lt;/h1&gt;

  &lt;section&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this section, we discuss the lesser known forest elephants.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/section&gt;

  &lt;section&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Habitat&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Forest elephants do not live in trees but among them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/section&gt;

  &lt;aside&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;advertising block&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;footer&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;(c) 2010 The Example company&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/footer&gt;</pre>

<p>This leads to the following outline:</p>

<pre>1. Forest elephants
   1.1 Introduction
   1.2 Habitat
</pre>

<h3 id="Definir_cabeçalhos">Definir cabeçalhos</h3>

<p>While the HTML Sectioning elements define the structure of the document, an outline also needs headings to be useful. The basic rule is simple: the first HTML heading element (one of <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/h1" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;h1&gt;</code></a>, <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/h2" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;h2&gt;</code></a>, <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/h3" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;h3&gt;</code></a>, <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/h4" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;h4&gt;</code></a>, <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/h5" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;h5&gt;</code></a>, <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/h6" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;h6&gt;</code></a>) defines the heading of the current section.</p>

<p>The heading elements have a <em>rank</em> given by the number in the element name, where <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/h1" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;h1&gt;</code></a> has the <em>highest</em> rank, and <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/h6" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;h6&gt;</code></a> has the <em>lowest</em> rank. Relative ranking matters only within a section; the structure of the sections determines the outline, not the heading rank of the sections. For example, consider this code:</p>

<pre class="brush:xml">&lt;section&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Forest elephants&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In this section, we discuss the lesser known forest elephants.
    ...this section continues...
  &lt;section&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Habitat&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Forest elephants do not live in trees but among them.
        ...this subsection continues...
  &lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;Mongolian gerbils&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In this section, we discuss the famous mongolian gerbils.
     ...this section continues...
&lt;/section&gt;</pre>

<p>This creates the following outline:</p>

<pre>1. Forest elephants
   1.1 Habitat
2. Mongolian gerbils</pre>

<p>Note that the rank of the heading element (in the example <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/h1" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;h1&gt;</code></a> for the first top-level section, <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/h2" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;h2&gt;</code></a> for the subsection and <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/h3" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;h3&gt;</code></a> for the second top-level section) is not important. (Any rank can be used as the heading of an explicitly-defined section, although this practice is not recommended.)</p>

<h3 id="Implicit_sectioning">Implicit sectioning</h3>

<p>Because the HTML5 Sectioning Elements aren&apos;t mandatory to define an outline, to keep compatibility with the existing web dominated by HTML4, there is a way to define sections without them. This is called <em>implicit sectioning</em>.</p>

<p>The heading elements (<a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/h1" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;h1&gt;</code></a> to <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/h6" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;h6&gt;</code></a>) define a new, implicit section when they aren&apos;t the first heading of their parent, explicit, sections. The way this implicit section is positioned in the outline is defined by its relative rank with the previous heading in its parent section. If it is of a lower rank than the previous heading, it opens an implicit sub-section of the section. This code:</p>

<pre class="brush:xml">&lt;section&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Forest elephants&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In this section, we discuss the lesser known forest elephants.
    ...this section continues...
  &lt;h3 class=&quot;implicit subsection&quot;&gt;Habitat&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Forest elephants do not live in trees but among them.
    ...this subsection continues...
&lt;/section&gt;</pre>

<p>leading to the following outline:</p>

<pre>1. Forest elephants
   1.1 Habitat <em>(implicitly defined by the h3 element)</em>
</pre>

<p>If it is of the same rank as the previous heading, it closes the previous section (which may have been explicit!) and opens a new implicit one at the same level: </p>

<pre class="brush:xml">&lt;section&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Forest elephants&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In this section, we discuss the lesser known forest elephants.
    ...this section continues...
  &lt;h1 class=&quot;implicit section&quot;&gt;Mongolian gerbils&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Mongolian gerbils are cute little mammals.
    ...this section continues...
&lt;/section&gt;</pre>

<p>leading to the following outline: </p>

<pre>1. Forest elephants
2. Mongolian gerbils <em>(implicitly defined by the h1 element, which closed the previous section at the same time)</em>
</pre>

<p>If it is of a higher rank than the previous heading, it closes the previous section and opens a new implicit one at the higher level:</p>

<pre class="brush:xml">&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Mammals&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;Whales&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In this section, we discuss the swimming whales.
    ...this section continues...
  &lt;section&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;Forest elephants&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this section, we discuss the lesser known forest elephants.
      ...this section continues...
    &lt;h3&gt;Mongolian gerbils&lt;/h3&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Hordes of gerbils have spread their range far beyond Mongolia.
         ...this subsection continues...
    &lt;h2&gt;Reptiles&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Reptiles are animals with cold blood.
          ...this section continues...
  &lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;</pre>

<p>leading to the following outline:</p>

<pre>1. Mammals
   1.1 Whales <em>(implicitly defined by the h2 element)</em>
   1.2 Forest elephants <em>(explicitly defined by the section element)</em>
   1.3 Mongolian gerbils <em>(implicitly defined by the h3 element, which closes the previous section at the same time)</em>
2. Reptiles <em>(implicitly defined by the h2 element, which closes the previous section at the same time)</em>
</pre>

<p>This is not the outline that one might expect by quickly glancing at the heading tags. To make your markup human-understandable, it is a good practice to use explicit tags for opening and closing sections, and to match the heading rank to the intended section nesting level. However, this is not required by the HTML5 specification. If you find that browsers are rendering your document outline in unexpected ways, check whether you have sections that are implicitly closed by heading elements.</p>

<p>An exception to the rule of thumb that heading rank should match the section nesting level is for sections that may be reused in multiple documents. For example, a section might be stored in a content-management system and assembled into documents at run time. In this case, a good practice is to start at <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/h1" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;h1&gt;</code></a> for the top heading level of the reusable section. The nesting level of the reusable section will be determined by the section hierarchy of the document in which it appears. Explicit section tags are still helpful in this case.</p>

<h3 id="Sectioning_roots"><a name="sectioning_root">Sectioning roots</a></h3>

<p> A <a id="sectioning root" name="sectioning root">sectioning root</a> is an HTML element that can have its own outline, but the sections and headings inside it do not contribute to the outline of its ancestor. Beside <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/body" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;body&gt;</code></a> which is the logical sectioning root of a document, these are often elements that introduce external content to the page: <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code></a>, <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;details&gt;</code></a>, <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/fieldset" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code></a>, <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/figure" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;figure&gt;</code></a> and <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;td&gt;</code></a>.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre class="brush:xml">&lt;section&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Forest elephants&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;section&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this section, we discuss the lesser known forest elephants&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/section&gt;
  &lt;section&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Habitat&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Forest elephants do not live in trees but among them. Let&apos;s
       look what scientists are saying in &quot;&lt;cite&gt;The Forest Elephant in Borneo&lt;/cite&gt;&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
       &lt;h1&gt;Borneo&lt;/h1&gt;
       &lt;p&gt;The forest element lives in Borneo...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
</pre>

<p>This example results in the following outline:</p>

<pre>1. Forest elephants
   1.1 Introduction
   1.2 Habitat</pre>

<p>This outline doesn&apos;t contain the internal outline of the <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code></a> element, which, being an external citation, is a sectioning root and isolates its internal outline.</p>

<h3 id="Sections_outside_the_outline">Sections outside the outline</h3>

<p> HTML5 introduces two new elements that allow defining sections that don&apos;t belong to the main outline of a web document:</p>

<ol>
 <li>The HTML Aside Section Element (<a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/aside" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;aside&gt;</code></a>) defines a section that, though related to the main element, doesn&apos;t belong to the main flow, like an explanation box or an advertisement. It has its own outline, but doesn&apos;t belong to the main one.</li>
 <li>The HTML Navigational Section Element (<a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;nav&gt;</code></a>) defines a section that contains navigation links. There can be several of them in a document, for example one with page internal links like a table of contents, and another with site navigational links. These links are not part of the main document flow and outline, and are generally not initially rendered by screen readers and similar assistive technologies.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="Cabeçalhos_e_Rodapés">Cabeçalhos e Rodapés</h3>

<p>HTML5 also introduces two new elements that can be used to mark up the header and the footer of a section:</p>

<ol>
 <li>The HTML Header Element (<a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/header" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;header&gt;</code></a>) defines a page header — typically containing the logo and name of the site and possibly a horizontal menu — or section header, containing perhaps the section&apos;s heading, author name, etc. <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;article&gt;</code></a>, <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;section&gt;</code></a>, <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/aside" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;aside&gt;</code></a>, and <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;nav&gt;</code></a> can have their own <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/header" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;header&gt;</code></a>. Despite its name, it is not necessarily positioned at the beginning of the page or section.</li>
 <li>The HTML Footer Element (<a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/footer" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;footer&gt;</code></a>) defines a page footer — typically containing the copyright and legal notices and sometimes some links — or section footer, containing perhaps the section&apos;s publication date, license information, etc. <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;article&gt;</code></a>, <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;section&gt;</code></a>, <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/aside" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;aside&gt;</code></a>, and <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;nav&gt;</code></a> can have their own <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/footer" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;footer&gt;</code></a>. Despite its name, it is not necessarily positioned at the end of the page or section.</li>
</ol>

<p>These do not create new sections in the outline, rather, they mark up content inside sections of the page.</p>

<h2 id="Addresses_in_sectioning_elements">Addresses in sectioning elements</h2>

<p>The author of a document often wants to publish some contact information, such as the author&apos;s name and address. HTML4 allowed this via the <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/address" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;address&gt;</code></a> element, which has been extended in HTML5.</p>

<p>A document can be made of different sections from different authors. A section from another author than the one of the main page is defined using the <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;article&gt;</code></a> element. Consequently, the <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/address" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;address&gt;</code></a> element is now linked to its nearest <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/body" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;body&gt;</code></a> or <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;article&gt;</code></a> ancestor.</p>

<h2 id="Utilizar_elementos_de_HTML5_nos_navegadores_não_HTML5">Utilizar elementos de HTML5 nos navegadores não HTML5</h2>

<p>Sections and headings elements should work in most non-HTML5 browsers. Though unsupported, they don&apos;t need a special DOM interface and they only need a specific CSS styling as unknown elements are styled as <code>display:inline</code> by default:</p>

<pre class="brush: css">article, aside, footer, header, hgroup, nav, section {
  display:block;
}
</pre>

<p>Of course the web developer can style them differently, but keep in mind that in a non-HTML5 browser, the default styling is different from what is expected for such elements. Also note that the <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/time" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;time&gt;</code></a> element has not been included, because the default styling for it in a non-HTML5 browser is the same as the one in an HTML5-compatible one.</p>

<p>This method has its limitation though, as some browsers do not allow styling of unsupported elements. That is the case of the Internet Explorer (version 8 and earlier), which need a specific script to allow this:</p>

<pre class="brush:xml">&lt;!--[if lt IE 9]&gt;
  &lt;script&gt;
    document.createElement(&quot;article&quot;);
    document.createElement(&quot;aside&quot;);
    document.createElement(&quot;footer&quot;);
    document.createElement(&quot;header&quot;);
    document.createElement(&quot;hgroup&quot;);
    document.createElement(&quot;nav&quot;);
    document.createElement(&quot;section&quot;);
    document.createElement(&quot;time&quot;);
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;![endif]--&gt;
</pre>

<p>This script means that, in the case of Internet Explorer (8 and earlier), scripting should be enabled in order to display HTML5 sectioning and headings elements properly. If not, they won&apos;t be displayed, which may be problematic as these elements are likely defining the structure of the whole page. That&apos;s why an explicit <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/noscript" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code></a> element should be added inside the <a href="/pt-PT/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>&lt;head&gt;</code></a> element for this case:</p>

<pre class="brush:xml">&lt;noscript&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This web page requires JavaScript to be enabled.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;JavaScript is an object-oriented computer programming language
    commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/koeeaJ&quot;&gt;How to enable JavaScript?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;
</pre>

<p>This leads to the following code to allow the support of the HTML5 sections and headings elements in non-HTML5 browsers, even for Internet Explorer (8 and older), with a proper fallback for the case where this latter browser is configured not to use scripting:</p>

<pre class="brush:xml">&lt;!--[if lt IE 9]&gt; &lt;script&gt;
  document.createElement(&quot;article&quot;);
    document.createElement(&quot;aside&quot;);
    document.createElement(&quot;footer&quot;);
    document.createElement(&quot;header&quot;);
    document.createElement(&quot;hgroup&quot;);
    document.createElement(&quot;nav&quot;);
    document.createElement(&quot;section&quot;);
    document.createElement(&quot;time&quot;);   &lt;/script&gt; &lt;![endif]--&gt; &lt;noscript&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This web page requires JavaScript to be enabled.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;JavaScript is an object-oriented computer programming language
    commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/koeeaJ&quot;&gt;How to enable JavaScript?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt; &lt;![endif]--&gt;
</pre>

<h2 id="Conclusão">Conclusão</h2>

<p>The new semantic elements introduced in HTML5 bring the ability to describe the structure and the outline of a web document in a standard way. They bring a big advantage for people having HTML5 browsers and needing the structure to help them understand the page, for instance people needing the help of some assistive technology. These new semantic elements are simple to use and, with very few burdens, can be made to work also in non-HTML5 browsers. Therefore they should be used without restrictions.</p>
