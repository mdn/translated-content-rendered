<p>MDN is made up of a vast community of contributors. While we can't offer profiles of all of them (we'd be here for a very long time!), we can share something about a few of the ones who have made substantial or important contributions, as well as those who are most likely to be available on the <a href="https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#mdn:mozilla.org">MDN Web Docs chat room</a> to help you out if you could use some assistance with your contributions.</p>

Priyanka mainly enjoys evangelizing MDN, hosting MDN events and introducing more people to MDN, along with making some edits on the wiki at times. She is currently working as a Technical writer at Red Hat and she proudly claims that her interest in technical writing started through her MDN contributions, which ended up influencing her career decision in a great way.</p>
