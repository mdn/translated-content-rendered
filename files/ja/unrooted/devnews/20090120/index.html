<h2 id="addon" name="addon">Add-on developers: time to update for Firefox 3.1</h2>
<p>Firefox 3.1 development is well under way. Nick Nguyen <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/addons/2009/01/09/public-service-announcement-update-your-add-ons-to-31/">writes</a>, “3.1 is coming! We know that many add-on developers have held off on testing for 3.1 compatibility because they’re waiting for a near-final release to test against. I’m happy to report that as of <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all-beta.html">Firefox 3.1b2</a>, no changes are planned which should affect add-on compatibility. Don’t hesitate! With each subsequent beta, more people make the switch and having 3.1 compatibility will ensure a seamless upgrade experience for your users.” For more information, see <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/addons/2009/01/09/public-service-announcement-update-your-add-ons-to-31/">Nick’s original blog post</a> at the Add-ons weblog. The Mozilla Developer Center also has an article about <a href="/ja/docs/Updating_extensions_for_Firefox_3.1">Updating extensions for Firefox 3.1</a>.</p>
<h2 id="mozilla" name="mozilla">Mozilla Community Store</h2>
<p>Tara Shahian <a href="http://musingt.com/?p=41">writes</a>, “The <a href="https://communitystore.mozilla.org/">Community Store</a> garnered a lot of excitement when it launched, and a big part of its success can be attributed to the collection of great designs that were already on display in the gallery.” In addition to the artwork available when the store opened, some fantastic <a href="https://communitystore.mozilla.org/gallery/recent">new designs have been added</a> since. Also, if you like the illustration style of a particular artist, simply click on the artist name to view a portfolio of all their submitted work. You can submit your own designs, too — just head over to the <a href="https://communitystore.mozilla.org/upload">Upload Tool</a> to get started.</p>
<h2 id="ubiquity" name="ubiquity">Ubiquity add-on update</h2>
<p><a href="http://labs.mozilla.com/">Mozilla Labs</a> has announced the most recent release of <a href="http://ubiquity.mozilla.com/">Ubiquity</a>, an experimental add-on that aims to make the Web easier to use through natural language. “We are proud to announce Ubiquity 0.1.5. Since the last major update, Ubiquity has gained a sleeker look and a smarter, more stable core.” Ubiquity can now also be skinned using simple CSS. If you already have Ubiquity, it will automatically update itself, or you can get the latest version at the project site. For more information about this release, see the <a href="http://labs.mozilla.com/2009/01/major-ubiquity-update/">original Labs blog post</a>.</p>
<h2 id="mozillalabs" name="mozillalabs">Mozilla Labs’ Personas add-on</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://labs.mozilla.com/">Mozilla Labs</a> team has released <a href="http://vimeo.com/2832032">another video interview</a>, this one about the Mozilla Labs’ <a href="http://getpersonas.com/">Personas</a> experiment. “Mozilla Labs’ Personas — although still in beta — is an extension that adds lightweight theming to your browser, allowing dynamic changes to how your Firefox looks. Suneel Gupta sat down to talk about what it means to have the browser’s look-and-feel reflect our personality, passions, and mood. And he’s <a href="https://labs.mozilla.com/forum/?CategoryID=18">looking for feedback</a>.” You can download and try this experimental add-on through <a href="http://getpersonas.com/">GetPersonas.com</a>.</p>
<h2 id="firebug" name="firebug">Firebug test cases online</h2>
<p>John J. Barton has blogged that the <a href="http://getfirebug.com/tests/">Firebug test cases are now online</a>. “Often users will have a sequence of Firebug operations that fails for them, but we need a page to try the sequence. Now when a user has a bug report without a test case we can offer some example files for their test procedure.” For more information, see <a href="http://blog.getfirebug.com/?p=48">John’s blog post</a>.</p>
<h2 id="testing" name="testing">Testing Fennec</h2>
<p>The mobile team is getting ready to deliver its first beta of <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Fennec">Fennec</a> (aka “Firefox Mobile”) next month, and the Mozilla Quality Assurance community is looking for help with testing this release. “This is exciting news as everybody who has seen Fennec has great things to say about it. If you haven’t had a chance to see Fennec first hand, I encourage you to <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/fennec/1.0a2/releasenotes/#install">download it and give it a try</a> (it also works on your desktop). With mobile internet becoming a cornerstone for many of the new devices, there is a much greater need for Fennec. We just recently added Symbian as a supported OS which makes 3 following Maemo and Windows Mobile. The beta we will be delivering next month will be for Maemo only as that is the most stable platform.” There are lots of opportunities if you want to get involved with the <a href="http://quality.mozilla.org/projects/fennec">Fennec testing project</a>, and more information is available on the <a href="http://quality.mozilla.org/blogs/ramping-fennec">QMO weblog</a>.</p>
<h2 id="xulrunner" name="xulrunner">XULRunner releases</h2>
<p>Mark Finkle recently posted about two <a href="https://dev.mozilla.jp/localmdc/localmdc_8607.html">XULRunner</a> releases — one <a href="http://starkravingfinkle.org/blog/2009/01/xulrunner-1905/">official</a>, and one <a href="http://starkravingfinkle.org/blog/2009/01/unofficial-xulrunner-191-builds/">unofficial</a>. “The newest official XULRunner has been released. XULRunner 1.9.0.5 matches the Firefox 3.0.5 release. For XULRunner developers, most of the changes in 1.9.0.5 are related to security fixes. You can also look at the <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?keywords_type=anywords&amp;keywords=fixed1.9.0.5+verified1.9.0.5">full list of fixed bugs</a>.” The unofficial builds are for XULRunner 1.9.1. “These are unofficial and may not be configured exactly the same as official builds. I was not able to get the Mac Universal build working. If you’re an extension, XUL app or plugin developer, these builds should help you move ahead with your Firefox 3.1 (Mozilla 1.9.1) development.” See <a href="http://starkravingfinkle.org/blog/">Mark’s weblog</a> for more information and comments.</p>
