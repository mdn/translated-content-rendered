<p class="summary"><span class="seoSummary">CSS layout is the art of using various CSS properties to alter the positioning of elements on a document in order to fit the design requirements.</span> CSS provides many layout mechanisms, the more advanced and modern techniques are so complex that they get their own articles. In this article, we will introduce the basic techniques that have been used for years.</p>

<p>To properly layout a document with CSS, there are a few notions that one must know. The most important of these is <a href="/ko/docs/Glossary/HTML">HTML</a> text flow. We will cover it in this article. Articles about other layout mechanisms will, at some point or the other, refer back to what we are discussing here.</p>

<h2 id="The_flow">The flow</h2>

<p>At its most basic level an HTML document is a text document structured with <a href="/ko/docs/Glossary/Tag">tags</a>. In such a document, the text <em>flows</em>. That means text is displayed in the reading direction (from left to right, for example, in Latin based languages like English or French) and is broken automatically - creating new lines - each time the text reaches an edge of the document.</p>

<p><img alt src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/11955/line-break-flow.svg" style="height: auto; max-width: 450px;"></p>

<p><img alt src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/11955/line-break-flow.svg#large" style="height: auto; max-width: 450px;"></p>

<p>Each <a href="/ko/docs/Glossary/Element">elements</a> in the document alters the flow of text in various ways:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Some elements can simply follow the text flow as if they were non-existent.</li>
 <li>Some elements can force a line break at any point in the flow whether it has reached the edge of the document or not.</li>
 <li>Some elements can create a new text flow for their inner content independent from the main text flow.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="디스플레이_요소_Elements_display_categories">디스플레이 요소 (Elements display categories)</h3>

<p>CSS is used to define how an HTML element behaves within the flow and how it get in and out of that flow. The element behavior is defined using the property <a href="/ko/docs/Web/CSS/display" title="display CSS 속성은 요소를 블록과 인라인 요소 중 어느 쪽으로 처리할지와 함께, 플로우, 그리드, 플렉스처럼 자식 요소를 배치할 때 사용할 레이아웃을 설정합니다."><code>display</code></a>. This property can take tons of values but let&apos;s focus on the four most important:</p>

<dl>
 <dt>none</dt>
 <dd>모든 요소를 제거 합니다.</dd>
 <dt>inline</dt>
 <dd>줄을 바꾸지 않고, 해당 위치에서 다른 요소들과 같은 선상에 위치하려는 성질을 말합니다. </dd>
 <dt>block</dt>
 <dd>This value is for the element to break the text flow with a forced line break before and after it. Its content is no longer part of the global text flow and flows only within the constraints provided by the element <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Basics/Box_model">box model</a>.</dd>
 <dt>inline-block</dt>
 <dd>This value makes the element somewhat in between inline and block type display: like <code>inline</code> boxes it flows with the text normally but, like block boxes, it&apos;s content is no longer part of the global text.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Let&apos;s see an example.</p>

<p>HTML:</p>

<pre class="brush: html notranslate">&lt;p class=&quot;none&quot;&gt;
  1. I&apos;m a big black cat,
  &lt;span&gt;walking under a ladder,&lt;/span&gt;
  and I can see broken mirrors everywhere.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;inline&quot;&gt;
  2. I&apos;m a big black cat,
  &lt;span&gt;walking under a ladder,&lt;/span&gt;
  and I can see broken mirrors everywhere.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;block&quot;&gt;
  3. I&apos;m a big black cat,
  &lt;span&gt;walking under a ladder,&lt;/span&gt;
  and I can see broken mirrors everywhere.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;inline-block&quot;&gt;
  4. I&apos;m a big black cat,
  &lt;span&gt;walking under a ladder,&lt;/span&gt;
  and I can see broken mirrors everywhere.
&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>

<p>CSS:</p>

<pre class="brush: css notranslate">span {
  width: 5em;
  background: yellow;
}

.none span         { display: none;         }
.inline span       { display: inline;       }
.block span        { display: block;        }
.inline-block span { display: inline-block; }</pre>

<h2 id="Altering_the_flow">Altering the flow</h2>

<p>By setting the display property you&apos;re already altering the flow, but you can go further.</p>

<h3 id="Text_layout">Text layout</h3>

<p>While an HTML document is nothing more than a long text flow, CSS provides many properties to deal with simple text layout. The text layout is everything that allows changing the text line breaking rules and the way the text is positioned over the natural text line.</p>

<p>Those properties are: <a href="/ko/docs/Web/CSS/hyphens" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>hyphens</code></a>, <a href="/ko/docs/Web/CSS/text-align" title="CSS text-align 속성은 블록 요소나 테이블 칸 상자의 가로 정렬을 설정합니다."><code>text-align</code></a>, <a href="/ko/docs/Web/CSS/text-align-last" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>text-align-last</code></a>, <a href="/ko/docs/Web/CSS/text-indent" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>text-indent</code></a>, <a href="/ko/docs/Web/CSS/vertical-align" title="vertical-align CSS 속성은 inline 또는 table-cell box에서의 수직 정렬을 지정합니다."><code>vertical-align</code></a>, <a href="/ko/docs/Web/CSS/white-space" title="CSS white-space 속성은 요소가 공백 문자를 처리하는 법을 지정합니다."><code>white-space</code></a>, <a href="/ko/docs/Web/CSS/word-break" title="word-break CSS 요소는 문자가 내용 밖으로 벗어날 경우, 이를 줄바꿈할 것인지에 대한 여부를 설정합니다."><code>word-break</code></a>, and <a href="/ko/docs/Web/CSS/word-wrap" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>word-wrap</code></a>.</p>

<p>Except for <code>text-align and<font face="Open Sans, Arial, sans-serif">, </font></code><code>text-indent </code>the other properties have subtle effects on the text and <code>vertical-align</code> is often used with inline-block boxes.</p>

<p>An example will make things clearer.</p>

<p>HTML:</p>

<pre class="brush: html notranslate">&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;WHEN Scrooge awoke, it was so dark, that looking out of bed, he could scarcely distinguish the transparent window from the opaque walls of his chamber. He was endeavouring to pierce the darkness with his ferret eyes, when the chimes of a neighbouring church struck the four quarters. So he listened for the hour. To his great astonishment the heavy bell went on from six to seven, and from seven to eight, and regularly up to twelve; then stopped. Twelve! It was past two when he went to bed. The clock was wrong. An icicle must have got into the works. Twelve! He touched the spring of his repeater, to correct this most preposterous clock. Its rapid little pulse beat twelve: and stopped.&lt;/p&gt;

<div class="note notecard">
<p>As you might notice, some properties are written multiple times with some prefix. This is because those prefixed properties are still experimental for some browsers and it is considered best practice to use them all with the standard property at the end of the list in order to provide the best backward compatibility possible.</p>

<div class="note notecard">
<p>It&apos;s worth noting that the trick we used to compensate the negative text indentation is a very common trick. Any property that accepts a length also accepts negative values. By fiddling with negative values and compensating them with other properties,  it&apos;s possible to produce very clever effects on the layout, especially when it applies to properties of the box model.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Floating">Floating</h3>

<p>Okay, handling text is nice, but at some point what we really want is to move boxes around the document. The first way to handle that is to deal with floating boxes. Floating boxes are still attached to the global text flow,  but the text will flow around. Sounds weird, so let&apos;s see an example.</p>

<h4 id="Simple_floating">Simple floating</h4>

<p>HTML:</p>

<pre class="brush: html notranslate">&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;excerpt&quot;&gt;&quot;Why, it isn&apos;t possible,&quot; said Scrooge, &quot;that I can have slept through a whole day and far into another night. It isn&apos;t possible that anything has happened to the sun, and this is twelve at noon!&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; The idea being an alarming one, he scrambled out of bed, and groped his way to the window. He was obliged to rub the frost off with the sleeve of his dressing-gown before he could see anything; and could see very little then. All he could make out was, that it was still very foggy and extremely cold, and that there was no noise of people running to and fro, and making a great stir, as there unquestionably would have been if night had beaten off bright day, and taken possession of the world. This was a great relief, because &quot;three days after sight of this First of Exchange pay to Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge or his order,&quot; and so forth, would have become a mere United States&apos; security if there were no days to count by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>

<p>CSS:</p>

<pre class="brush: css notranslate">.excerpt {
  /* A floating box will act like a block whatever
     the value of display we are using */
  display: block;

  /* Our box is floating to the left, which means
     it will stack on the left side of the containing
     block and the text will flow on its right side. */
  float: left;

  /* It is required to set a width to a floating box.
     If we don&apos;t its width will be set
     automatically, which means that it will grow as much
     as possible and nothing will flow around it, like an
     ordinary block box */
  width: 40%;

  /* We set some margins on the right and bottom side of
     the box to avoid having the text flowing around being
     in direct visual contact of our floating box */
  margin: 0 1em 1em 0;

  /* We make our floating box more visible with
     a simple background color */
  background: lightgrey;

  /* As we have a solid background color it&apos;s a nice idea
     to push the content a little bit away from the edges
     of the box */
  padding: 1em;
}</pre>

<h4 id="Layout_with_floating">Layout with floating</h4>

<p>This is a very simple effect to start tweaking the flow to our wishes. Now it&apos;s possible to do better and start performing some true layout. A floating box that floats in a given direction stacks horizontally, it&apos;s a very convenient way to create rows of boxes instead of natural columns: In the flow, block boxes stack in columns and floating boxes stack in rows.</p>

<p>Once again, an example will make things clearer.</p>

<p>HTML:</p>

<pre class="brush: html notranslate">&lt;div class=&quot;layout&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;cell size50&quot;&gt;Scrooge went to bed again, and thought, and thought, and thought it over and over and over, and could make nothing of it. The more he thought, the more perplexed he was; and the more he endeavoured not to think, the more he thought.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;cell size50&quot;&gt;Marley&apos;s Ghost bothered him exceedingly. Every time he resolved within himself, after mature inquiry, that it was all a dream, his mind flew back again, like a strong spring released, to its first position, and presented the same problem to be worked all through, &quot;Was it a dream or not?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;cell size100&quot;&gt;Scrooge lay in this state until the chime had gone three quarters more, when he remembered, on a sudden, that the Ghost had warned him of a visitation when the bell tolled one. He resolved to lie awake until the hour was passed; and, considering that he could no more go to sleep than go to Heaven, this was perhaps the wisest resolution in his power.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;cell size33&quot;&gt;The quarter was so long, that he was more than once convinced he must have sunk into a doze unconsciously, and missed the clock. At length it broke upon his listening ear.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;cell size33&quot;&gt;
      &quot;Ding, dong!&quot;&lt;br&gt;
      &quot;A quarter past,&quot; said Scrooge, counting.&lt;br&gt;
      &quot;Ding, dong!&quot;&lt;br&gt;
      &quot;Half-past!&quot; said Scrooge.&lt;br&gt;
      &quot;Ding, dong!&quot;&lt;br&gt;
      &quot;A quarter to it,&quot; said Scrooge.&lt;br&gt;
      &quot;Ding, dong!&quot;&lt;br&gt;
      &quot;The hour itself,&quot; said Scrooge, triumphantly, &quot;and nothing else!&quot;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;cell size33&quot;&gt;
      He spoke before the hour bell sounded, which it now did with a deep, dull, hollow, melancholy ONE. Light flashed up in the room upon the instant, and the curtains of his bed were drawn.
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>

<p>CSS:</p>

<pre class="brush: css notranslate">/* This is our main layout container */
.layout {
  /* A background makes it visible */
  background: lightgrey;

  /* We add a small visual spacing to harmonize
     the distance between the cells content and

  padding   : 0.5em;
}

/* A floating box gets somewhat out of
   the flow, so if their container is empty
   it will have a zero height size and the
   floating box will overflow it. To
   avoid such a situation, we make sure floating
   boxes are not allowed to overflow. In
   that specific context, with an overflow
   hidden, floating boxes won&apos;t be clipped,
   the parent box will extend to avoid any
   floating box overflow.  */
.row {
  overflow: hidden;
}

/* Each cell is a left floating box */
.cell {
  float : left;

  /* we add padding to our cell to create
     some nice visual gutters between them */
  padding   : 0.5em;

  /* Because we are adding padding, we need
     to be sure that it will not impact
     the box width. */
  box-sizing: border-box;

  /* As margins cannot be controlled with the
     box-sizing property, we need to be sure
     there is none applied to our cell. */
  margin    : 0;
}

/* Those are the sizes we can apply to our boxes */
.size33  { width:  33%; } /* Not exactly a third, but good enough */
.size50  { width:  50%; } /* A half */
.size100 { width: 100%; } /* A full row */</pre>

<p>Using floating boxes this way, is what many CSS frameworks do. It&apos;s a robust and well-known technique but it has limits as everything must go with the flow: it&apos;s not possible to handle boxes in arbitrary order, variable sizing can be quite tricky to achieve, and vertical centering is impossible. We encourage you to dig deeper as <a href="http://www.positioniseverything.net/articles/onetruelayout/">floating boxes has been studied for long</a> and they are among the most robust solutions for a simple layout that must be compatible with legacy browsers.</p>

<p>If you want to better understand all the subtleties of floating boxes, we encourage you to read <em><a href="https://css-tricks.com/all-about-floats/">All about float</a></em> by Chris Coyer.</p>

<h3 id="Positioning">Positioning</h3>

<p>If floating boxes are still part of the flow, another mechanism exists to perform some layouts by extracting boxes out of the flow: CSS Positioning. Positioning is acheived by defining a positioning context with the <a href="/ko/docs/Web/CSS/position" title="CSS position 속성은 문서 상에 요소를 배치하는 방법을 지정합니다. top, right, bottom, left 속성이 요소를 배치할 최종 위치를 결정합니다."><code>position</code></a> property and then allows boxes to be positioned using <a href="/ko/docs/Web/CSS/top" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>top</code></a>, <a href="/ko/docs/Web/CSS/left" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>left</code></a>, <a href="/ko/docs/Web/CSS/right" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>right</code></a>, and <a href="/ko/docs/Web/CSS/bottom" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>bottom</code></a> properties.</p>

<p>The <a href="/ko/docs/Web/CSS/position" title="CSS position 속성은 문서 상에 요소를 배치하는 방법을 지정합니다. top, right, bottom, left 속성이 요소를 배치할 최종 위치를 결정합니다."><code>position</code></a> property can take on four different values:</p>

<dl>
 <dt>static</dt>
 <dd>This is the default value for all elements: they are part of the flow and don&apos;t define any specific positioning context.</dd>
 <dt>relative</dt>
 <dd>With this value, elements are still part of the flow, but they can be visually moved around their positions with <a href="/ko/docs/Web/CSS/top" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>top</code></a>, <a href="/ko/docs/Web/CSS/left" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>left</code></a>, <a href="/ko/docs/Web/CSS/right" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>right</code></a>, and <a href="/ko/docs/Web/CSS/bottom" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>bottom</code></a>. They also define a positioning context for their children elements.</dd>
 <dt>absolute</dt>
 <dd>With this value, elements are pushed out of the flow and no longer influence it. The position of such blocks is defined by the <a href="/ko/docs/Web/CSS/top" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>top</code></a>, <a href="/ko/docs/Web/CSS/left" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>left</code></a>, <a href="/ko/docs/Web/CSS/right" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>right</code></a>, and <a href="/ko/docs/Web/CSS/bottom" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>bottom</code></a> properties. The 0,0 position point for the top/left corner of the box is the top/left corner of the closest parent element which defines a positionning context other than <em>static</em>. If there is no parent with a positioning context, then, the 0,0 position point for the top/left corner of the box is the top/left corner of the document.</dd>
 <dt>fixed</dt>
 <dd>With this value, elements are pushed out of the flow and no longer influence it. The position of such blocks is define by the <a href="/ko/docs/Web/CSS/top" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>top</code></a>, <a href="/ko/docs/Web/CSS/left" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>left</code></a>, <a href="/ko/docs/Web/CSS/right" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>right</code></a>, and <a href="/ko/docs/Web/CSS/bottom" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"><code>bottom</code></a> properties. The 0,0 position point for the top/left corner of the box is the top/left corner of the browser window <a href="/ko/docs/Glossary/Viewport">viewport</a>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Such positioned boxes can stack on top of each other. In that case, it&apos;s possible to change the stacking order by using the <a href="/ko/docs/Web/CSS/z-index" title="CSS z-index 속성은 위치 지정 요소와, 그 자손 또는 하위 플렉스 아이템의 Z축 순서를 지정합니다. 더 큰 z-index 값을 가진 요소가 작은 값의 요소 위를 덮습니다."><code>z-index</code></a> property.</p>

<p>Okay, let&apos;s see an example to visualize it at work.</p>

<p>HTML:</p>

<pre class="brush: html notranslate">&lt;div class=&quot;relative&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;absolute-one&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Position:absolute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Top Right&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;absolute-two&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Position:absolute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Bottom Centre&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;absolute-three&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Position:static&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Where it falls&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>

<p>CSS:</p>

<pre class="brush: css notranslate">p {

<p>If CSS positioning isn&apos;t really used for full layout, it is used quite often to deal with trick UX effect such as navigation layout, tooltip and such. This is something you&apos;ll see on a regular basis so we encourage you to get into it. Among various resources about it, we suggest you take a look at the article <em><a href="http://alistapart.com/article/css-positioning-101">CSS positioning 101</a></em> by Noah Stokes.</p>
